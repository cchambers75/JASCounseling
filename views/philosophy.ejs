            <h1>My Counseling Philosophy</h1>

            <p class="mt-3">My approach to therapy recognizes that our emotional suffering stems from our struggle to restore harmony between past and present experiences with our desire for a happy and fulfilling life. My goal within therapy is to provide a safe environment to help you explore your feelings, thoughts, and experiences. My belief is that the relationship between the client and therapist leads to growth and change. I strive to provide a safe, nonjudgmental environment for the people I work with. My aim as a therapist is to see you as a whole person and work together to see how past experiences, beliefs, and feelings impact you currently. I am eager to partner with people while gaining insight, understanding, and moving towards growth.</p>

            <h1>Areas of Practice</h1>

            <p class="mt-3">I am trained and have helped individuals struggling with anxiety, depression, trauma, postpartum, grief and loss, behavioral issues, relationship issues (including infertility and infidelity), and self-worth. I have extensive experience working with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. I have also helped individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves and find meaning and clarity in their life and relationships. My goal is to help you find authentic change and to help you better understand your true self. I am also LGBTQIA+ affirming.</p>
